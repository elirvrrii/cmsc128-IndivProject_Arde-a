# WHAT TO-DO. (Updated: 14/10/2025)
What TO-DO is a web application in partial fulfillment of requirements for CMSC 128 (A.Y. 2025-2026). It is the first individual lab activity among three (or four?) others. (Updated note: this web app now handles two individual lab activities)

## Description
What TO-DO is one of many web to-do lists scattered all over the internet. It has basic functionalities such as adding a task, editing, and deleting said task. Users can add a task by typing in its name, due date, due time, and priority. These details can be edited later on should the need arises. Aside from its basic features, users can easily sort through their tasks with the sorting buttons situated on the right side of the screen. Overall, it provides everything a user may need when it comes to a to-do list.

Currently, it contains a login/signup and profile page that is not yet connected to the actual web application. The third lab activity for this course will be able to integrate both the to-do list and the account management.

## Languages Used
For frontend:
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* Javascript

For backend:
* Firebase (Realtime Database and Authentication)

Firebase is a collection of cloud-based services offered by Google. Considered as BaaS, Firebase provides different platforms for developers such as app hosting, cloud storage, and authentication. This application uses Firebase's Realtime Database services as a means of storing the data for rendered tasks. Firebase was used due to how efficient and flexible it is as backend and it reduced the complexities of dealing with other backend-leaning languages.

## Executing the Program

Users can simply open the to-do-list.html file on their web browser of choice.

For the account management portion, users may simply open sign-up.html.
