Firebase is a collection of cloud-based services offered by Google. Considered as BaaS, Firebase provides different platforms for developers such as app hosting, cloud storage, and authentication. This application uses Firebase's Realtime Database services as a means of storing the data for rendered tasks. Firebase was used due to how efficient and flexible it is as backend and it reduced the complexities of dealing with other backend-leaning languages.
